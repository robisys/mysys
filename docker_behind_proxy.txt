Let's connect to the Docker machine by typing

docker-machine ssh default

Once connected to the Docker machine, get root access by typing

sudo -s

Then configure the proxy:

echo "export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@corporate.proxy.com:port" >> /var/lib/boot2docker/profile
echo "export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@corporate.proxy.com:port" >> /var/lib/boot2docker/profile

You can verify that they've been written to the profile file by typing:

cat /var/lib/boot2docker/profile

Then exit out of root by typing exit and then exit out of the SSH session by typing exit again.

Finally restart the Docker machine by typing

docker-machine restart default

Success!
