Summary

In networks where external DNS servers are blocked, Docker containers running on Ubuntu hosts can't resolve DNS at all because they are trying to use 8.8.8.8 as their DNS server. Docker should detect the network DNS server.
Detail

When spinning up a container, Docker will by default check for a DNS server defined in /etc/resolv.conf in the host OS, and if it doesn't find one, or finds only 127.0.0.1, will opt to use Google's public DNS server 8.8.8.8.

My development machine is running Ubuntu 16.04 which uses dnsmasq by default, so /etc/resolv.conf is always set to 127.0.0.1, even though it is usually actually getting its DNS settings from whatever network its connected to:

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver  # What Docker sees
nameserver 127.0.1.1
$ nmcli dev show | grep IP4.DNS  # My actual DNS server
IP4.DNS[1]:                             10.1.1.3

and so Docker containers always default to using 8.8.8.8 rather than using the same DNS server as the host OS.

In my office network external DNS servers are blocked, and so me and my whole team are finding docker containers failing with obscure errors which result from failing to resolve DNS.

There is a workaround, which I help walk all my team members through so they can still use Docker. Although it's frustrating that whenever Docker gets updated, it seems the daemon config file is overwritten and we have to implement the fix all over again. This is less of a problem for me, but is causing significant trouble for our less systems-focused developers.

Is there any hope that Docker might be able to intelligently pick up the network's DNS server in the future?
Steps to reproduce the issue

    Use a host OS that makes use of dnsmasq (e.g. Ubuntu since 12.04)
    Connect to a network that blocks access to external DNS servers like 8.8.8.8
    Try to resolve DNS with Docker (docker run busybox nslookup google.com)

What I get

$ docker run busybox nslookup google.com
Server:    8.8.8.8
Address 1: 8.8.8.8

nslookup: can't resolve 'google.com'

What I expected

$ docker run busybox nslookup google.com
Server:    10.1.1.3
Address 1: 10.1.1.3

Name:      google.com
Address 1: 2a00:1450:4009:811::200e lhr26s02-in-x200e.1e100.net
Address 2: 216.58.198.174 lhr25s10-in-f14.1e100.net

The systemd unit file should not be edited directly.
Systemd has a facility called "drop-ins" that allow you to override/augment the unit file.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/

In addition, it would probably be best to configure the docker daemon via it's config file rather than the systemd unit file. By default docker reads config from /etc/docker/daemon.json. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#linux-configuration-file

I've solved this by adding a daemon configuration file. But I would sure love for this to be implemented.

@cpuguy83 Nice one, I didn't know about the /etc/docker/daemon.json. Might that file get created in a default install to signal to users this is where configuration should live? I went straight for the systemd drop-ins.

It is not very easy to implement this as docker has no way to know the
upstream servers. If you set your local DNS relay on localhost to also
listen on the docker0 IP and put that address in resolv.conf that would
also work.

@justincormack I can discover the DNS servers by doing nmcli dev show | grep DNS. Couldn't docker do something similar? I mean, more generally, if the system knows its DNS servers (which it must) then surely docker can discover them somehow.
@awilkins
awilkins commented on 19 Sep 2016 â€¢ edited

On Ubuntu, I settled on doing this ( as @justincormack describes) by...

    Adding a /etc/docker/daemon.json that passed in the docker0 bridge IP as a DNS server
    Adding a /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/docker-bridge.conf file that directs the NM-managed DNS cache to listen to the docker0 bridge IP as well as 127.0.1.1

Now container DNS lookups go through your local dnsmasq instance, so DNS in the container should work just as well as DNS on the host.

@nottrobin - my problem specifically was that my system did know it's DNS servers and was passing them to the container - but because those servers were on a VPN, there was no route to them from inside the container, hence all DNS lookups failed. This was partly down to the non-NetworkManager based VPN client we're using that overwites resolv.conf. Turned that "feature" off and instead added config for that subdomain on NetworkManager's dnsmasq itself.

@nottrobin nmcli only applies to systems running NetworkManager, there is not an equivalent for other setups.

Containers cannot resolve DNS if docker host uses 127.0.0.1 as resolver #541

Thank you A LOT for the workaround @nottrobin, working great even when doing "docker build"
It had been three days of looking for a solution without success before finding your post

Your solution works @awilkins.

Additionally it requires to allow port 53 traffic on the ubuntu firewall for the docker0 bridge ip.

Quick test: disable the ubuntu firewall completely with sudo ufw disable

@bsingr what rule did you use? I've tried loads and can't get it to work on Ubuntu 16.04 - i've resorted to host network mode ðŸ˜­

Add support in embedded DNS server for host loopback resolver docker/libnetwork#1595
@sanimej
Contributor
sanimej commented on 19 Dec 2016

@nottrobin Instead of trying to detect the external resolver used by the host resolver the better approach is to allow the containers' DNS queries to be forwarded to the host resolver if the resolv.conf has a loopback address. Using the host resolver has other use cases as well. Its doable with the docker embedded DNS server which is used by default for user defined networks. I pushed a PR in libnetwork for this.
@butlermd
butlermd commented on 9 Jan

@awilkins or @bsingr, do either of you have more details about how you configured docker-bridge.conf? The daemon.json file seems like it should be simple enough:

{
  "dns": [
    "172.17.0.1"
  ]
}

But I'm unclear on how you configured dnsmasq.
@awilkins
awilkins commented on 9 Jan â€¢ edited

On ubuntu, add a file /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/docker-bridge.conf

listen-address=172.17.0.1

By default it only listens to DNS requests from 127.0.0.1 (ie, your computer). This tells it to listen to the docker bridge also.
@butlermd
butlermd commented on 9 Jan

@awilkins Thanks for the clarification!

Also looks like a PR with support for doing this less cryptically landed a few days ago in libnetwork

AFAIK though this won't work for the docker0 network bridge.

sanimej commented on 9 Jan

@awilkins Yes, it doesn't work for docker0 bridge because the Docker DNS server is used only for the user created networks. The fix to forward the queries to host loopback resolver relies on the embedded DNS server.

Local name servers are not used #18

dqminh commented 28 days ago

@sanimej just to make sure i understand the patch correctly, it only allows docker embedded DNS server to forward queries to the local nameserver ?

We are using https://github.com/gliderlabs/hostlocal, which will still be required if we dont want to use docker embedded DNS server, is that correct ?
@sanimej
Contributor
sanimej commented 27 days ago

@dqminh Yes, this patch essentially differentiates between loopback IP in the container namespace vs host namespace. This allows the embedded DNS server to forward the queries appropriately. From a quick glance it looks like hostlocal package is intended to be used with containers in net=host mode. This patch is not relevant in that case.

dqminh commented 27 days ago

@sanimej i think hostlocal should work in bridge mode as well since it adds a route in the host. Thanks for the confimation about the embedded DNS server.
@setiseta
setiseta commented 14 days ago

hm, just to ask, is it possible to setup a dnsmasq in a container as default dns for other dockers in any way?
i just cant find a description about this on the internet.
is this not possible?
